# spotify_DA_ETL
This project demonstrates an Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) pipeline using Spotify data.   It extracts raw song/artist data (via Spotify API or dataset), transforms it into a clean and structured format, and loads it into a database for analysis.   The main objective is to showcase data engineering, pipeline automation, and music analytics.
